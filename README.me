📘 NeetCode Problems — Python & C++ Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the NeetCode problem lists (NeetCode 150, 250, Blind 75, etc.), implemented in both Python and C++.

Each folder is organized by topic (Arrays, Two Pointers, DP, Graphs, Trees, Backtracking, etc.), and every problem includes:

✔️ Clean, optimal solution

✔️ Clear code structure in both languages

✔️ Occasional multiple approaches (brute force → optimal)

The goal of this repo is to track progress, improve problem-solving skills, and build a strong reference for interview preparation.
